# Movie Recommendation
This project is totally based on recommendation system. We are recommendating movie based on user rating.

## What is Recommendation System ?
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users 
are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for 
them.
